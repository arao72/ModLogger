# ModLogger
A functional and basic logging system for your discord server. This bot was made for my community server a couple weeks ago, so I thought I'd show the source code.

## How to test
Try kicking a person who's up for it, and make sure you put in the exact names for everything in the configs.py file. 

### Want more of this?
